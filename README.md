# code-samples
This repo contains Richard Campo's code samples.

The data I used are from the 2022 American Community Survey downloaded from
[IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/).

I prepared the data before graphing and analyzing by creating the following 
variables:
- EDUCDC: Years of education derived from EDUCD
- AGESQ: AGE squared
- WHITE: =1 if white
- BLACK: =1 if black
- HISPANIC: =1 if Hispanic
- MARRIED: =1 if married
- VET: =1 if a veteran
- HSDIP: =1 if graduated from high school but not college
- COLDIP: =1 if graduated from college or higher
- HSDIP-EDUCDC: interaction
- COLDIP-EDUCDC: interaction
